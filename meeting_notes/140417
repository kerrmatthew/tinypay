notes:

our point of difference is we don't need to support anyone, we can do the easy ones and promise the future.

we can use paypal apple pay and android pay to make it easyier. maybe use our own system later. 

2 clicks to auth, that's it. 

track using cookies, useragent, and ip. We can figure out how to get emails later (do we get them from apple pay anyways?) 

lets design some flows for web base case using tiny paywall.
